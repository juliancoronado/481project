## Tetris-AI for CPSC 481

### Project Scope:
We created an artificial intelligence that simulates the evolutionary process in human biology to become a better player. The project utilizes a genetic algorithm to represent individual players (genomes) and a fitness function to evaluate the pool of genomes.

**Tools: Python 3, Pygame**
